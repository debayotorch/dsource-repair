                        <li><h1>There are multiple issues with my device, do you offer repair bundles?</h1></li>
                        <dd>Sure we do please just give us a call at 1-877-300-0000 and we will see what we can set up for you.</dd>
                        <li><h1>So I tried to fix my iPhone on my own and have it semi unassembled. Can I send it to you and have you finish the repair?</h1></li>
                        <dd>Absolutely, we do that all the time for customers. Please purchase the diagnostic service and send your phone in. A technician will call you the same day we receive it with a quote before beginning any work on your iPhone.</dd>
                        <li><h1>Do you repair any other kind of phones?</h1></li>
                        <dd>Of course! If you have managed to break your cell phone, odds are we can fix it. Browse our repair services.</dd>
                        <li><h1>Do you repair iPods or any other Apple products?</h1></li>
                        <dd>In addition to iPhone repairs, we offer a wide varitey of iPod, iPad, and Mac repairs. If you are interested in a repair please contact a support representative at 1-877-300-0000 or browse our repairs section.</dd>
                        <li><h1>Do I have to checkout online to mail in a phone for repair?<h1></li>
                        <dd>Though is it preferred that you checkout on line prior to sending in your iPhone it is not required. Checking out online prior to sending in your phone helps us expedite the repair process as we will have easy access to your information and do not need to delay the repair to wait for payment. If you would prefer to send in your iPhone without purchasing a service online please include your contact information and a brief explanation of the issue(s) you are experiencing with the iPhone. This will help us minimize any repair delays and return your phone as fast as possible.</dd>
                        <li><h1>Do you offer any type of warranty on your repairs?</h1></li>
