                        <li><b>There are multiple issues with my device, do you offer repair bundles?</h1></b>
                        <dd>Sure we do please just give us a call at 1-877-300-0000 and we will see what we can set up for you.</dd>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <li><b>So I tried to fix my iPhone on my own and have it semi unassembled. Can I send it to you and have you finish the repair?</b></li>
                        <dd>Absolutely, we do that all the time for customers. Please purchase the diagnostic service and send your phone in. A technician will call you the same day we receive it with a quote before beginning any work on your iPhone.</dd>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <li><b>Do you repair any other kind of phones?</b></li>
                        <dd>Of course! If you have managed to break your cell phone, odds are we can fix it. Browse our repair services.</dd>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <li><b>Do you repair iPods or any other Apple products?</b></li>
                        <dd>In addition to iPhone repairs, we offer a wide varitey of iPod, iPad, and Mac repairs. If you are interested in a repair please contact a support representative at 1-877-300-0000 or browse our repairs section.</dd>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <li><b>Do I have to checkout online to mail in a phone for repair?</b></li>
                        <dd>Though is it preferred that you checkout on line prior to sending in your iPhone it is not required. Checking out online prior to sending in your phone helps us expedite the repair process as we will have easy access to your information and do not need to delay the repair to wait for payment. If you would prefer to send in your iPhone without purchasing a service online please include your contact information and a brief explanation of the issue(s) you are experiencing with the iPhone. This will help us minimize any repair delays and return your phone as fast as possible.</dd>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <li><b>Do you offer any type of warranty on your repairs?</b></li>
                        <dd>Yes, all repairs carry a 90 day parts and labor warranty which means if you have any issues related to the repair within 90 days we will take care of it free of charge!</dd>

          <p><li><b>Do you need my SIM Card?</b><li>
		  Nope. We have our own SIM cards to test the phone with, no need to send yours.
			 <li><b>Do you need my pass code?</b></li>
				Yes we do. If there is a pass code on the phone it hinders our ability to test all the functions of the device. Please provide your pass code with the device when you send it in for repair. If you do not wish to provide your pass code, certain device functions including but not limited to; the camera, wifi and bluetooth cannot be tested and cannot be guaranteed.
			 <li><b>Can you bill my shipping account with FedEx or UPS for return shipping?</b></li>
				Sure, please just call a customer service representative at 1-877-300-0000 to make the proper arrangements. Please note, we are not responsible for packages lost in transit back to the customer if they supply their own shipping label or shipping account.
				I donâ€™t feel comfortable buying a part for repair service on the website. Are there any other ways I can pay?
				Sure to arrange other forms of payment please call our Customer Service Representatives at 1-877-300-0000 and they would be happy to assist you.
			 <li><b>Do you offer any type of warranty on your repairs?</b></li>
